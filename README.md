* If one student tests positive, app will notify the instructor to not let the student in the lecture. The student will be asked to report other students that he has contacted recently. The reported students and the students in the same section with the covid positive student will be notified and need to get tested before entering the lectures.

* If the instructor tests positive for covid it will notify students, who attended the class from the last 3 days, to get a test. 

* Before each lecture, present the state of each section and a list of students who can attend the class to the instructor.
