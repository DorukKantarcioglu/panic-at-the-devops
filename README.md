## Group Name: Panic At The DevOps
## Pandemic Manager for the University

**Project Description:** 
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pandemic Manager is a tool to assist university during the pandemic. It is an app where professors can see which student is covid-positive. Moreover, it will allow students to know the covid status of the professor and the section. 
<br>  
**Project Functions:**

* If one student tests positive, app will notify the instructor to not let the student in the lecture. It will also notify
the students in the same section to get tested for covid because of contact.

* If the instructor tests positive for covid it will notify students, who attended the class from the last 3 days, to get a test. 

* Before each lecture, present the state of each section and a list of students who can attend the class to the instructor.

* Keep track of which student has how many days of quarantine left for the instructor and administrators.

* If a student is not vaccinated, it will keep track of his covid test intervals and remaining time until next test

* Advice professors to make the lectures hybrid/online according to the percentage of covid-negative students in the section.
